This is Zeph, checking in from a small campsite north of Dyersville,
Iowa. It has been a heck of a few days, and as expected, the emotional
difficulties of distance touring are far more challenging than the
physical.

But first, this update is (not really) sponsored by

  * Roadside butterflies. Roadside butterflies: somehow almost as fast as a
      slow biker, but much cuter.
  * In-depth farm equipment tours. Learn the difference between a tractor
      and a combine, and see just how much work goes into maintaining them.
      In-depth farm equipment tours: your glimpse into farm life.
  * Dry sleeping socks: a little slice of heaven, right in your tent.
  * And finally, this is brought to you by comfy bike gloves: offering
      traction and sun protection in one day-glo package.


Now that I've got my sponsors out of the way, back to the weather.
*[okay, you can use your normal reading voice from here on out]*

A bit of context, first. My first two days on the road, the biggest
environmental hazard was heat. It was in the eighties for long chunks of
the day, and so early starts and aggressively staying on top of hydration
were my priorities. Day three got a bit wet, but it was so hot that the
occasional drenching was a relief more than a hassle. On day four, I
felt strong and confident, entered Iowa, and started to encounter my first
hills of the trip. (So much for Iowa being flat and windy.)

That all changed yesterday, on day five of my trip, with forecasted
afternoon thunderstorms and wind.

## Hope

So I got an early start, and pounded out almost thirty miles before the
rain started to really threaten. Then the rain didn't just threaten, but
dump. In buckets. Continuously. With no end in sight. I'm not gonna sugar
coat this; it was a real slog. After about an hour of this, something
strange happened in my brain. It ceased to be productive to suffer through
it, so my brain just...stopped suffering it and just embraced it. If you're
gonna be wet and cold, you might as well be cheerfully wet and cold. To be
clear, I had very little conscious control over that process – it kind of
just happened. But I started belting out showtunes, enjoying the descents
(did I mention this part of Iowa is hilly?), and I just kept pedaling.

Don't get me wrong, I was very grateful to reach my home for the night, a
heated and roof-covered lovely house with delightful and welcoming hosts
(and a long hot shower). But in the meantime, I got along okay and stopped for
snacks and drinks *almost* as often as I probably should have.

## Despair

Then today dawned. I knew going in that there would be a high in the
forties and rain most of the day. Worse, I'd have a 15 mph headwind pretty
much all day.

And as it promised, so it went. It was cold, and wet, and windy, and far
hillier than I thought Iowa should be. Between the headwind and my tired,
cold legs, I was averaging 4.5 mph on the uphills, and I struggled to
manage my temperature. I'd zip my raincoat all the way up to protect myself
from the cold and wet, then start sweating and unzip a bit, then get cold and
rezip, and so on. I stopped in a small town to warm up a bit in the
library, though I'm still not convinced that was a good idea – my hands
certainly warmed up, but the rest of me cooled off from biking and then had
to ease back into it again afterwards. I rapidly reset my sights, from
Colesburg (a 65 mile day) to Dyersville (a 45 mile one), to "just one more
mile".

It's the worst I've felt on this trip so far, and I confess that I had many
moments of thinking "why am I doing this?! I could be home and warm and dry
right now". Heck, some part of me is still thinking that. I'm really not
sure how many days like that I can take. Really, the idea of biking across
the country is appealing when it's fun, or at least fun-ish. It's much less
appealing when it's sheer misery.

I don't have any conclusions or answers from this. Just that I'm at a low
point. We'll see what tomorrow brings – it is at least supposed to stop
raining, and the wind should die down a bit; I may even see glimpses of the
sun. May it bring higher morale and dry socks.
