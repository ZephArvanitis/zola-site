Hello and greetings from the northwest American heat wave. Hard to believe
I've gotten caught in not one but two historic heat waves on this trip, but
here we are. I'm biking primarily early in the morning (sunrise here:
4:15am) and spending my nights in places where I have cooling options,
whether that's A/C or frigid lakes I can sit in. I start crossing the
Cascades tomorrow morning with Sherman's Pass. Wish me luck!

I thought I'd answer another common question in this email: what the heck
I'm carrying.


<!-- more -->

One thing I don't know is how much all this stuff weighs. Some part of me
really doesn't want to know! But I'll say that it's markedly easier to
pedal around unloaded, so the gear definitely adds up.

But first, some pictures.

I encountered a road crew, and they let me place a median reflector! I was
unreasonably stoked. Here it is!

Montana does not have a monopoly on beauty – here are just a few gorgeous
Washington spots.

Okay, back to gear. (You can skip this if you don't care; I promise there's
no key plot points buried in here.)

So, what am I carrying? I'll go through this bag by bag, since by this
point in my tour every item has a home.

## Front panniers
  * Tent (body, tarp, ground tarp, poles)
  * Raincoat and rain pants
  * Less-used repair gear: patch tape, tent pole repair kit, spare inner
      tube, oil for my chain, repair kit for my sleeping pad, spare brake
      cables and pads, sewing kit...
  * Sleeping bag (down, far warmer than I probably needed but nice on those
      around-freezing nights)
  * Sleeping pad, bag to inflate it, sleeping bag liner, cotton T shirt,
      light but comfy scarf to use as improvised pillowcase, sleep socks,
      headlamp
  * Microfiber towel for showering
  * A highly compressed daypack made of ripstop nylon, so that I can tote
      gear along on a hike/short trip if I want to.
  * Unscented detergent for laundry
  * Kula cloth (a personal hygiene thing, google it if you so desire)

## Rear panniers
  * An IKEA bag containing stuff I don't need too often *while* biking:
    * Stove, stove rack, pot, a spare spork, lighter, can opener
    * Fuel canister with denatured alcohol or yellow heet for my stove.
        Also a small funnel for pouring fuel back into the canister.
    * Two-liter water bladder – empty when it's short distances between
        towns, full otherwise
    * Flip flops (camp shoes!)
  * 24-oz water bottle (usually full)
  * Sunscreen
  * Chamois cream
  * Bug cream
  * Tiny bike pump
  * Water-resistant stuff sack with extra layers: a fleece, a puffy, a
      buff, wool gloves, and a windbreaker
  * Drybag with definitely-stay-dry stuff:
    * Charging cables and an incredible battery pack, which can happily
        power my phone for at least two weeks
    * Kindle
    * Notebook/journal
    * Sharpie and pencil
  * Laptop in its own waterproof case
  * Stuff sack of other clothes
  * Miscellaneous toiletries (unscented only) and medication, retainer
  * First aid kit, double bagged in ziploc
  * InReach for GPS and satellite texting
  * Solar powered lantern

## Bear can
  * Food (see previous email)
  * More food
  * Scented toiletries
  * Soap (in future I'm just bringing Dr. Bronners, I think, rather than
      bar soap + bar shampoo + Dawn dish soap)
  * Collapsible bowl and mug (mug has a lid, which is critical)
  * Titanium fork, knife, and spoon
  * One paring knife, with plastic sheath

## Handlebar bag
  * A pen
  * SPF 20 chapstick
  * Snacks for the day
  * Electrolytes for the day
  * Microfiber cloth (very small)
  * Soft case for my sunglasses (I'd ditch this in future)
  * Compass and whistle (just in case)
  * Hand sanitizer
  * Bike gloves, if I'm not wearing them
  * My magical homemade map holder
  * Adventure Cycling map, folded to current location

## Saddle bag (repair kit)
  * Miscellaneous bike multitools
  * A regular multitool
  * Patch kit
  * Tire irons
  * Duct tape
  * Zip ties

## Other (mounted on bike)
  * Two water bottles (22-oz, though if I were doing it again I'd up those
      to 24-oz)
  * A relatively robust cable lock
  * My cycle computer – effectively odometer and speedometer
  * A rear view mirror (in future I'm getting one that sticks up from the
      handlebar instead of down)
  * USB-powered front and rear lights with both steady and blinking
      settings
  * A kickstand


All told, this kit has served me well, though it will certainly be modified
in places for any future tours. I'll probably go through and put together a
more exhaustive list at some point, but I think this gives you at least a
sense for what I'm carrying.

With that, I'm off for my 7:30pm bedtime. Farewell!

Zeph
