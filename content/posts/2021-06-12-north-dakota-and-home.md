I made it to Fargo, North Dakota! I'm at just about a thousand miles, and
delighted with where this trip has taken me. I have a couple logistical
updates and a lot of gratitude for the kindness of strangers. But first, a
few scenery pics:

Mystery of the week: what's the story with these cylindrical buildings with
trees growing out of them? (I have no idea; my guess is old silos, replaced
by more modern ones?)

are also visible."

## Logistical updates
I've now biked about a thousand miles, including parts of Illinois, Iowa,
Wisconsin, Minnesota, and North Dakota. My legs are no longer shockingly
sore, just normal sore. And I finally have a "right place" for all my
miscellaneous possessions on my bike.

I've also taken a tiny detour...back to Chicago! Biking gave me a lot of
time to think, and that helped me realize that connections with people in
my life are more important to me than some arbitrary biking goal. And one's
grandparents don't have a 60th wedding anniversary every day! So I'm back
in the Chicago area to celebrate my grandparents with a bunch of (fully
vaccinated) extended family. Happy anniversary!

To do this, I hopped on an Amtrak train at 3am in Fargo, North Dakota, and
disembarked about 13 hours later in Chicago's Union Station. Fun fact: the
Fargo train station is only staffed from midnight to 7:30am each day,
because it's only got the two trains: one eastbound and one westbound, at
2am-ish and 3am-ish respectively. I was very grateful that I opted to ride
a folding bike! Although the Empire Builder line does allow bikes, it
allows a limited number, and those slots were booked up on the day I wanted
to travel. But with my fold-in-half bike I was able to hop on the train
regardless, which was a huge relief.

## On the kindness of strangers
This has been my first real travel experience since Covid hit North
America, and honestly it's been incredibly refreshing. Cooped up at home,
it's easy to read the news and think "wow, people are terrible". And it's
true that there are some awful things happening in the world. But it's easy
to forget that the vast, vast majority of people are fundamentally decent
human beings. This trip has helped remind me of that by bringing me into
contact with a multitude of strangers. I've been welcomed, invited into
conversations, fed, housed, and deeply touched by the people I've met.

I'm not one of those word wizards who can help you feel the way I have felt
recently. But maybe if I share a couple anecdotes you can get a sense for
how awesome people have been.

* On one very rainy day, I stopped in at a gas station to get out of the
    rain (immediately dripping a puddle on the floor) and eat something
    warm. I ended up having a lovely conversation with some other patrons
    about other bikers in the area and how dang hilly it was. They had a
    credit card minimum charge,
    and when I couldn't dig out cash (as it was safely inside a dry
    saddlebag that I greatly wished to stay dry) and was scrambling to pick
    out some other purchases to get me above their minimum, the cashier
    said "hey, don't worry about it" and comped my slice of pizza. It was
    sweet, and I'm planning to pay it forward as the trip goes on.
* During this heat wave, I've made a habit of swimming when I can (three
    cheers for Minnesota's ten thousand lakes). One
    night I passed a little public beach in town as I made my way to my
    campsite. So when I had settled in and figured out how to pay for my
    camping, I struck up a conversation with some neighbors in RVs. They
    were excited to hear about biking and to share their own road-trip
    adventures, and at the end of the conversation I said "well I'm off to
    the watering hole for a little swim". One of the people I'd been
    talking to ran into their RV and emerged with an inflatable inner tube,
    which they offered to loan me for the afternoon. So I'm now one of
    those people who enjoys floating in the water for hours in the
    afternoon. Photo proof:

* I'm finally at the point in my trip where I've started to see other
    touring cyclists. So far I've encountered three groups (five people)
    traveling both east and west along the Northern Tier. That means I'm
    starting to learn the customs around catching up and exchanging news of
    the road. One day, I biked alongside a fabulous thru-biker for about 45
    minutes, chatting about how the road has been, previous adventures, and
    plans after reaching our respective destinations. The next morning I
    encountered two eastbound bikers and we pulled over to chat a bit. They
    talked about what the route past Fargo was like, and asked about
    traffic and topography in their near future. There's an instant feeling
    of camaraderie among other people willing to pack up their lives on a
    bike and hit the road. And it's fun to hear their stories or even just
    wave across a busy road.

* Finally, no discussion of the kindness of strangers would be complete
    without mentioning [Warm Showers](https://warmshowers.org) and the
    incredible hosts I've met through it. Thus far I've stayed with three
    different hosts, and each of them has been warm and welcoming in their
    own way. One time, I got a comprehensive tour of the family's farming
    equipment and lots of discussion about agriculture in Iowa. Another
    time I worked with a host to solve one of his kids' homemade escape
    rooms. Another I was welcomed with a veritable feast, invited to use
    their cars as needed, and then I talked late into the night about data
    science in potato farming. One host even was willing to drive me (and
    my gear and bike) to the train at one in the morning, complete with a
    driving tour of downtown Fargo. These hosts have been deeply kind and
    welcoming, and have helped me feel at home along the road.

In short, I've been reminded again and again how lovely people can be. I
still know there are mean/cruel/awful people out there, but that's not my
subconscious assumption anymore.

Okay, one final anecdote. My last night on the road before Moorhead, I
weathered the biggest thunderstorm I think I've ever experienced in the
outdoors. I ended up hunkering down in a plumbed and wired bathroom
building rather than my tent. The wind from the storm blew over my bike and
ripped six out of ten tent stakes from the ground (glad I did all the extra
tie-outs!), and RV campers said it was the worst thunderstorm they'd
experienced in at least 17 years. The next morning, I passed an old
farmhouse whose roof had been ripped off by the wind, scattering debris in
a nearby field and causing several cars to slow down for photos. Beyond the
sheer destructive power of the storm, it was really beautiful – before it
hit, before it was even close enough to hear thunder...it was like a
fireworks show, enhanced by fireflies closer to my tent. I was a bit out of
it, as I'd just woken up from three hours of sleep, but I'd have sworn that
the fireflies preferentially lit up right after a bright flash of
lightning. At first, I thought the little insects were sparks dancing over
the field.

Everyone wish my grandparents a happy anniversary!

Cheers,
