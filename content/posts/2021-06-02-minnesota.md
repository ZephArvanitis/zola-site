Greetings from Minnesota, friends! I crossed the Mississippi this afternoon
and am spending the night at Afton State Park, which has many things to
recommend it, including plumbed toilets, a biker-specific campsite, and
swimming in the river! And let me tell you, cooling off in a chilly river
after a long day of biking is pretty ideal.

Before I go any further, a note from some (not actual) sponsors:

  * Bald eagles. Practically a dime a dozen in this section of the country,
      and incredibly majestic. Bald eagles: if they can find a
      picture-perfect perch, they will.
  * Wisconsin cheese curds: squeaky delicious.
  * A household that *really* likes skis: because why not? (This is just a
      third of their ski fence)

  * Sore legs. Cuz even after all this time, these hills are still beating
      me up. Sore legs: you'd think they'd be stronger by now.

Anyway, the last two days, since La Crosse, have been lovely. The weather
has held up, though it's definitely getting a bit warm in the afternoons.
I've mostly been on Wisconsin's Great River Road, a truly delightful scenic
road that manages to show off pretty topography without forcing you to ride
up it, and which has consistently excellent shoulder space. It also, like
much of my route thus far, passes through fabulous small towns. Some recent
highlights:

  * The biggest cinnamon roll I've ever seen, from a little bakery in
      Fountain City, if I recall correctly. Don't worry, I managed to
      finish it without outside assistance.

  * Pepin, the birthplace of Laura Ingalls Wilder (author of Little House
      on the Prarie, among other works) and home to at least two related
      museums. Alas, I passed through too early this morning to avail
      myself of the lovely-looking bakery or historic sites.
  * A little locally-owned bar just past Stockholm, WI (not to be confused
      with the European city), which features a sign stating "We don't have
      wifi – you'll have to talk to each other".

And this afternoon, as I was winding down and starting to fade from a long
day of riding, I passed a small church building with beautiful music coming
out of it. The fence out front had a big "LOVE LIVES HERE" banner with
inclusive symbols, and the front door was open, so I set my bike against a
wall and stepped inside. Turns out it was a sound test for Sunday's
congregation. I met Father Scott, who has preached at the church for
nearly 15 years, and who since the death of the congregation's organist has
taken up organ generator programming to provide delightful music for hymns
and such. We had a lovely conversation about the building (original, first
built in the late 1800s), the congregation (30-50 people), and what it
means to be inclusive in 2021. It was fabulous to have a real conversation
with a friendly human, and sure helped me feel more at home in Minnesota.

And lucky me, I get to keep riding across Minnesota for the next week!

In no particular order and with severe bandwidth limitations, a couple of
scenic pics and selfies chosen at random because I need to head to sleep.
