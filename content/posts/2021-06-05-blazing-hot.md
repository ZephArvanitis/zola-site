I can't believe it – I've been on the road for two weeks. In that time,
I've pedaled over 800 miles and within parts of Illinois, Iowa, Wisconsin,
and Minnesota.

<!-- more -->

Thankfully, Minnesota has been (relatively) flat thus far,
which has allowed me to cover some serious ground the last few days,
despite only biking before noon to avoid the worst of the heat. For those
not living in the Midwest, or reading from the future, we've been slammed
with a heat wave the last few days. Pros: no rain, relatively little wind.
Cons: hundred-degree weather and roasting sunlight. So the last three days
or so I've been on the road before sunrise, biked for a few hours, and
stopped around noon.

Alas, the last two nights I've opted to shelter in hotels. Pros: not
getting heat illness, proximity to places with vegetables. Cons:
expensive, indoors. Ah, well. Tomorrow night is supposed to cool off a bit,
so I'm planning to still bike early but once again spend the night under
the stars.

But enough about the chief challenge for this section of the trip. I wanna
talk about how *incredibly stunning* Minnesota is. At least the parts I've
seen. Also, I should apologize for an error in my last email – I entered
Minnesota from Wisconsin not by crossing the Mississippi, but by crossing
the Saint Croix River. I crossed the Mississippi today, well within the
heart of Minnesota. Today I learned!

But yeah, this section of the country is gorgeous. Wide open areas,
forests, fabulous bird life, an incredible diversity of reptiles...words
don't really cover it. You'll just have to come see for yourselves. Just as
a single example, yesterday I spotted a teeny tiny snake wriggling along
the white line on the side of a road. If the road hadn't been busy, I'd
have stopped for a picture, but since I couldn't stop, imagine a tiny dark
wriggling shape ([serpentine motion – see this awesome graphic for the ways
snakes move](https://kids.britannica.com/students/assembly/view/171904)),
maybe five inches long and just a few millimeters wide,
only visible because of the bright white behind it. I've also seen a number
of adorable turtles (and sadly, a number of flattened ones as well), many
deer, especially thanks to my early morning departures, and of course farm
animals. And lots of goldfinches, plus a bird I keep seeing but can't
identify with a black cap and white and gray body perched on wires. It
holds itself a little like a swallow, but I *think* it's bigger? Anyway, a
beautiful, stately bird.

The other joy of today and the next two days of biking is an incredible
trail system that allows me to bike exclusively off roads for about a
hundred miles. The kicker? Today I was on the *Lake Wobegon Trail* of all
things. Highly recommend this system for anyone passing through here in the
future. It even has little bike repair stations and water fountains at
strategic locations.

Well, if you've made it through this long ramble, you deserve some quick
"stats" (all stats for just today, unless otherwise noted):

  * Sunrise: 5:29am
  * Departure time: 5:10am
  * Max temp today: 99 degrees Fahrenheit
  * Species of roadkill spotted: 5 (turtle, snake, raccoon, deer, robin)
  * Times I've been "chased away" by red-winged blackbirds: countless
  * Cow "stampedes" provoked: 2
  * Cute goats: 2 + 7 = 9
  * Rinses required to clean riding clothes: 6-ish (soft water didn't help)
