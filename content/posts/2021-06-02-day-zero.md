The night before my departure, and some second (and third) thoughts.

<!-- more -->

All day today I've been running around packing, unpacking, repacking, and
generally panicking. Good fun!

I think it's fairly normal before a big trip to feel a bit nervous. Maybe
even a tiny bit scared. If it's not...well, that's just me, then!

In any case, I think that I'm finally packed (except for two things drying
overnight). As is standard for early in a trip, there are definitely things
I've overpacked (cookable grains, anyone?), and there are probably things
I've left behind that I'll want. But to first order, I'm packed and
"ready". Hooray?

I've also got my first week roughly mapped out, and have contacted a
couple Warm Showers folks about sleeping in their yards. First rest day
destination: La Crosse, WI.
