Greetings!

Exciting news: I made it to Anacortes on Friday afternoon! I have a whole
bundle of feelings about completing my trip, so this will be a combination
of those feelings plus a couple summary stats and thoughts.

<!-- more -->

## Numbers
First, the easy stuff: numbers.

* Total biking days: 31
  * 21 nights camping
  * 8 nights with Warm Showers hosts
  * 4 nights in hotels
* Temperature range (Fahrenheit): 34-115 (I was also indoors when it
    reached as high as 125)
* States: 7 (IL, IA, WI, MN, ND, MT, WA)
* Total mileage: a bit under 2000 miles. I estimate my odometer is 1-3%
    fast, so that puts me at 1902-1941 miles to the Anacortes Ferry
    Terminal, plus a few more since then

See Appendix A for a full list of where I spent my nights and whether I was
sleeping in a tent, a house, or hotel.

## Challenges in retrospect
Today I was flipping through the journal I sporadically kept throughout my
trip. And I wanted to share a couple different excerpts I wrote about
challenges while facing them.

* Day 3: a list entitled "what hurts most now" (1) sunburn, 2) a specific
    quad muscle on my right side, 3) left shin, 4) saddle sores)
* Day 5: "I should have put my rainpants on up front. *Sheesh* was I cold"
* Day 10: "...the Great River Road, which managed both scenic, 3D views
    *and* some-might-call-it-boring-but-I-say-delightful relative flatness."
* Day 11: "I'm so tired. My legs are starting a rebellion – *no* *more*
    *hills*."
* Day 31: "it was HOT and hilly as hell."
* Day 32: "another beautiful day in Montana. Fewer craggy, snowbound peaks
    than Glacier, but I spent almost all day traveling through national
    forest, with majestic pines and cute flowers and rolling hills (ow my
    quads)."
* Day 36: "HOT. That was today. Tomorrow will be even worse, which
    uber-sucks."
* Day 37: "Just mind blowing how oppressively hot it was, really"

It's funny – some of these were deeply demoralizing in the moment. But now
that I've made it, they're just amusing anecdotes and fun to share

## Feelings
I'll confess, when I reached the ferry terminal in Anacortes, I was a bit
underwhelmed. I'd had this incredible, multi-week journey. I'd met
inspiring people, seen incredible landscapes, sat with myself for days and
weeks. And in comparison to all that, reaching this sort of arbitrary
endpoint was a bit...I don't know, underwhelming is the best word, I guess.
In my journal I noted "...it sort of felt incomplete. Maybe because I no
longer had a map to show me the way, both literally and figuratively. Maybe
because I was alone, and so much of my journey was about my relationship
with others. Maybe just because."

I definitely felt sad. Honestly, as soon as I finished crossing the
Cascades, I started realizing that my trip was coming to an end. And even
though it was hard, and long, and sometimes lonely, I was surprised to
realize how much I'd miss it. Now I'm feeling a bit nervous about how I'll
stay sane with eight hours a day in front of the computer instead of
riding.

But since my arrival, I've been welcomed with open arms to both Anacortes and
Bellingham by friends and friends of friends. I'm not sure whether it's
just a bit of distance, or the ability to see my adventure through the eyes
of people I care about, but now I'm feeling genuinely proud to have done
the thing, and welcomed into community, and just suffused with love and
warmth and a little sprinkling of joy. It feels good.

I did it.
