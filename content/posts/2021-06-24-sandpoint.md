The last four days, since departing Glacier, have been a bit of a blur. A
gorgeous, scenic blur, but a blur nonetheless. I'm writing now from
Sandpoint, Idaho, a thriving metropolis (population 7365) and the start
point of my final stretch.

A lot of people on the road (and following along from home) have been
asking about what I eat on tour, so this is a shorter than usual ramble on
that topic.


<!-- more -->

In short, eating enough on tour is HARD. I estimate I need about 4500
calories per day, and stopping for a big lunch often feels like a bad
option, since it requires me to re-warm up. So usually I eat:

  * A normal to large breakfast: oats, chia pudding, granola with dry
      milk, peanut butter and jelly tortillas...
  * 100-200 calories per hour while biking, in various snack forms. Recent
      highlights: hot and sweet peanuts, trail mix with m&ms, snickers
      bars, clif/luna bars, chex mix...
  * If I'm passing through a town, a larger pastry or other less
      travel-friendly snack (cinnamon rolls, apple fritters, muffins, etc.)
  * After stopping for the day, an immediate 200-500 calorie "snack" high
      in protein. Often another snacking-as-I-go snack, or maybe a packet
      of tuna
  * Dinner centered around a grain – pasta, rice, couscous, cracked wheat,
      fleshed out with olive oil to up the calorie count and dehydrated
      veggies for flavor and nutrients.
  * As much snacking as I want around camp – again trail mix or sometimes
      extra servings of oatmeal with dried fruit.


On special occasions I'll also eat a full meal in town, maybe stopping by a
cool restaurant or eating with a local host. 

All told, I think I'm doing at least okay on the food front, and I've
learned a lot about the kind of fuel my body needs for this sort of
exertion.


Final note:

Because of likely difficulty finding lodging on the weekend around July
Fourth, I've pushed my schedule a bit forward and made up a day. That's
meant some longer days, so thank goodness for my new bike fitness! My last
four days have been 81 miles, 67, 80, and today a leisurely 55 (I was
worried about thunderstorms in the afternoon, which didn't materialize in
the end).

In no particular order, a few photos that might not even be my best ones
from the last few days, but I'm tired and need to sleep.

I don't even remember where this one was, but it was pretty there!
