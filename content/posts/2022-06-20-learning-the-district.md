At the start of this year, I rejoined Mount Erie Fire Department (MEFD), a
volunteer fire + rescue district just south of Anacortes, WA. Onboarding
with the district involves learning a great deal: about fire, rescue, EMS,
standard operating procedures...and the district itself.

Here's the thing: I have the worst sense of direction of anyone I've ever
met. Like, I once got lost in a large parking lot. So the prospect of
learning my way around an unfamiliar area was daunting, to say the least.
The standard suggestion from experienced members was "oh, go drive around
in your free time, you'll figure it out." Which is great for them! But I
don't have that kind of faith in my navigational skills or memory. After a
bit of messing around, I ended up finding a pretty solid way to get to know
the district, so I wanted to share it in case it might be useful to others.

The big picture:

* I used QGIS and some general geographic know-how to generate an image
    highlighting every street in the district, with a general map as a
    backdrop. More info on how exactly I did that [here](/posts/qgis-atlas).
    The result looked something like this:

<div class="row">
<div class="offset-3 col-6">
<img src="/img/2022-07-20-sharpe-road.png" alt="A map of District 11 with Sharpe Road highlighted in red" class="center" width="100%">
</div>
</div>


* I put together a flashcard for every street in Anki, and ordered them so
    I'd learn big roads first and learn roads near each other in quick
    succession.
* I studied. A lot. For a couple of months. I did all the cards in "pick
    out the road on the map" mode first, then once I'd seen all of those
    once I incorporated the reverse – "look at this map; what is the name
    of the highlighted road?"
* Once I'd seen all the streets in flashcard form at least once, I started
    exploring. By bike where I could, by car where needed, once even on
    foot near the station. I took notes while I explored, not for my own
    reference (maybe someday?) but just so that I had something to actually
    do on each street.
* I asked loooooots of questions – "is the fastest way there along Campbell
    Lake or Rosario?" "Where's the cutoff point for going north versus
    south on highway 20 for Gibralter Road?" "So to get back to the station
    from here, are we going to go all the way to the end of Biz Point Road and
    use the turnaround there?" I learned a lot from the answers I got, with a
    side bonus of showing folks I was really putting in the effort to learn
    things, even if it was slow going.


And it's not like one can just stop learning with the streets. I'm still
adding flashcards for landmarks ("huh? what's Western Bud?" -Zeph, trying
to find an MVA one evening) and building other flavors of district
familiarity. Things like what areas have hydrants and where, which areas
are likely to be most difficult to protect from wildfire, how to navigate
when there's construction or road repair work going on...but now I'm
building all that on a solid foundation.

As a side benefit, I feel way more connected to the district now; there's
something special about knowing it well and continuing to learn about it
all the time, which I've never experienced in this way before.
