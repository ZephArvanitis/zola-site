Exciting news: I am now past the Cascades! After four (arguably five)
passes in four days, in a record-breaking heat wave, I am now just two days
from the western terminus of the Northern Tier, Anacortes. I've had some
interest expressed in pictures and tales of pre-dawn adventures, so here
you are.

## Biking in absurd heat
Okay, the elephant in the room: this heat wave. It was a real doozy.
Temperatures not just in the triple digits but in the hundred-teens,
overnight lows as high as 82, and unrelenting sunshine for *days*. So, I
present to you Zeph's Guide to Not Dying in the Heat.

</div>

1. If at all possible, just don't bike. Find a nice hotel with a pool,
   order pizza in, and sit it out. Your everything will thank you.
2. If you have to bike, do it early. Temperatures are lowest at dawn,
   usually. That means that the further before dawn you can start, the
   longer you'll get temperatures near the bottom of that temperature sine
   curve of death. This led to my new theory of starting schedules:
     * *Leisurely start*: you wake up whenever, read a book, prepare a nice
         breakfast, and hit the road when you feel like it.
     * *Early start*: you wake up at a relatively normal time (5-7am), pack
         up camp efficiently and get some calories in you, and get riding.
         This is often aided by truly awful hordes of hungry mosquitoes. My
         turnaround from wakeup to on the road ranges from 45-75 minutes.
     * *Dawn start* (aka blinky light start): you wake up early enough to
         be on the road when the sun is rising. Usually this means that 1)
         you have a bit of light to see by in packing up camp, and 2) once
         on the road, you'll want your front and rear lights blinking to
         increase your visibility to cars. Thus "blinky light start".
    * *Pre-dawn start* (aka steady light start): you wake up obnoxiously
        early (think 3:30am) and are on the road 45 minutes or more before
        sunrise. This will necessitate a headlamp or lantern, and you'll
        want your front light to be bright and steady so you can see the
        road in front of you.

    In case it wasn't clear, I've had four (five?) consecutive steady light
    starts, and now that I'm out of the heat wave I am struggling with a jet
    lag of 3-4 hours. It also helped that I was able to position myself
    right before a mountain pass each night, so my highest exertion fell
    early in the day, when it was still cool out.
3. Find cool places for when not biking. That means air conditioning and
   cold showers at least during the heat of the day and overnight – rest is
   important!
4. Know that hydration doesn't just fix all heat illness. No matter how
   much you drink, you are still vulnerable to heat exhaustion and heat
   stroke. It helps to give your body ten days to acclimatize to the heat
   – an hour of exercise in the heat for ten consecutive days triggers
   literal physiological changes in how you sweat, where your capillaries
   are, and generally how you can cope with high temperatures. But even
   that can only get you so far. So you'll need to be aware of the symptoms
   of heat illness and be ready to change your plans if needed.
5. That said, *hydrate*! You'll be sweating a LOT, which means you need to
   replenish those liquids and salts constantly. In practice, you probably
   can't keep up. So you'll have to play catch up when resting as well, and
   drink more than you think you need in the mornings before it gets really
   hot. And generally stay super on top of your body's needs.
6. Consider long-sleeved clothing. For one thing, it reduces your burn
   risk, which means one less thing to worry about. For another, it's
   helpful for water-based cooling. And for a third, at a certain point
   (about 105-110 Fahrenheit), it is *actually cooler* than short sleeves.
   This blew my mind. But yesterday in my last 2.5 miles, I tried rolling
   my sleeves up, thinking "I'm sweating and moving through the air, so
   this will help cool me off". And it actually didn't. It was *hotter*
   with my sleeves rolled up than down. So I now have first-hand experience
   in why desert nomads around the world have a propensity for
   loose, light-colored clothing.
7. Take advantage of cooling opportunities when you can. In my case, that
   means rivers, which thankfully are relatively plentiful in this part of
   the country. When I see a river, stream, or waterfall, I pull over and
   assess whether I can safely get to it and submerse some or all of myself
   in it. In a hurry, I can also dunk my long sleeve shirt in the water,
   wring it out over my head, and then put it back on. Boom, instant
   cooling for the next...10-30 minutes, depending on how long it takes to
   totally dry it out again. I'm guessing this also eases hydration
   requirements, as that's a little less sweat I have to produce, but I
   have zero evidence for that. As a bonus, many rivers in this neck of the
   woods are fed by snowmelt, so they can be very cold. If I'm willing to
   spare five minutes to just submerge in the water, I notice the effects
   for as long as ninety minutes afterward. This is also the move if you
   start to notice symptoms of heat illness, as it's a quick way to stop
   your core body temperature from increasing and start bringing it back to
   normal ranges.
8. If possible, just don't bike. Seriously. If I never again bike at
   temperatures above 100, that is a-okay by me.

## Lots of slow pedaling, or *The Cascades are incredible*
All the heat stuff aside, the last four days have been glorious,
incredible, stunning. I have multiple times been so struck by the scenery
that I've burst into tears and/or song. But before I share the pretty
pictures, a sign to strike fear into the hearts of bikers:

</div>
<br>

(Big yellow sign reads "Prevent radiator boilover – turn off air
conditioner". What do I do if I don't have A/C to turn off?!)

There's a long tradition of pictures in front of the pass signs once you
make it to the top, so here are my big four:

Sherman Pass (elevation 5575). 9:20am three days ago

And finally, the pictures you've all been waiting for.

Sunrise over a little ridgeline a couple days ago.

Another (pre-)sunrise, one day more recent. I liked the effect of multiple
rows of mountains, getting bluer as they get further away.

I don't remember the name of this river, or the snowy peak in the
background. But the combination was irresistible.

## Kindness of strangers, continued
By total fluke, my heat wave pedaling corresponded to a portion of the
country with excellent Warm Showers coverage. With just a bit of
planning, I was able to find a local host for three consecutive nights.
These hosts were kind enough to open their air-conditioned homes to a
cyclist smelling of sweat, suffering, and river water. They also went above
and beyond, sharing stories and food and politely not minding my request to
slip out quietly out before first light. I am incredibly grateful to them
all. 

Plus I got to meet some absolute badasses:

* A lovely couple experienced with hosting, who came highly recommended
  (with no prompting by me) by not one but two groups of cyclists I
  encountered on the road and swapped news with. In the sixteen hours I was
  there, I was treated to fresh-baked cookies, banana bread, and coffee
  cake, not to mention hearing countless stories of other cyclists they've
  hosted. And not content with safely housing one cyclist for the night,
  they took on another, an eastbound cyclist named Dave who stayed with
  them years ago on his first trip across the United States. (He later
  wrote a book about his trip – *Descent into Happiness*, of which I've
  read 82 pages and plan to read more.)
* A dad who cycled across the US both east to west and south to north with
    his wife and two kids on two tandems, with a rule about stopping at
    every playground along the way.
* Two lovely people whose wooing process involved a lot of local foraging.
    One described the other as winning them over by sharing a treasured
    stinging nettle patch. Now they grow just oodles of fruits and
    vegetables and jar/can/dry them for the winter. Their pantry is a thing
    of beauty. Oh, and did I mention they are raising meat ducks in their
    garage?
* A tour group of women over fifty riding eastward from Anacortes to Fargo,
    North Dakota. They were in good spirits despite meeting them at the top
    of Loup Loup Pass, a real climb. I hope to someday be as impressive as
    them. Their guides were also lovely and shared their Gatorade with me.
* A carpenter who learned the trade first from library books and then an
    apprenticeship, and has since build his own house. Incidentally, it
    closely approximates my ideal cabin. *takes notes*
