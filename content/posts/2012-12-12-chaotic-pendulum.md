This post was originally a paper written with Vivian Steyert for a class,
Theoretical Mechanics. In summer 2015 I adapted it for this blog. If you're

In writing this paper, Vivian and I investigated the behavior of a chaotic
pendulum present in a lab at Harvey Mudd through modeling and simulation in
_Mathematica_.  In the modeled system in the undamped, undriven case, we
observed small oscillations. With increasing drive frequency, the behavior
becomes chaotic, and a region of period doubling is present at frequencies
just above the chaotic regime. Both the onset of chaos and the general
shape of Poincaré plots are similar to those observed in the physical
system.

Introduction

The pendulum system consists of
an aluminum disk with uniformly-distributed mass $M$ and radius $R$, to
which is attached an eccentric mass of mass $m$, at the edge of the
disk. The setup is shown above. There is a
permanent magnet held close to the disk, which generates eddy currents
and thus produces a (hopefully) linear damping force. The disk is
attached to a pulley of radius $r$, which has a string wrapped around it
in such a way as to avoid slipping. This string is attached to a spring
on each side. The spring on the left side has a spring constant $k_1$,
and the one on the right has a spring constant $k_2$. The far end of
spring 2 is fixed. Finally, the whole system is driven by means of a
rotary motor fixed to the end of spring 1, which drives the spring
according to $De^{-i\omega t}$.

Equation of Motion
==================

We will use a single generalized coordinate $\theta$, which will
describe the angle between the vertical and the eccentric mass. We
define $\theta$ to be zero when the eccentric mass is at the top of the
disk, and to be positive in the clockwise direction, as shown.

Observe that the moment of inertia $I$ of the combined disk-mass system is
$$I = \frac{1}{2}MR^2+mR^2.$$
Thus the kinetic energy of the system is
$$T = \frac{1}{2}I\dot\theta^2 =
\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{1}{2}MR^2+mR^2\right)\dot\theta^2.$$
The potential
energy of the system is the sum of the gravitational and spring potential
energies. Define the stretch of the springs when the eccentric mass is in
unstable equilibrium at the top of the disk to be $x_1$ and $x_2$,
respectively. Then the potential energy of the system is

$$\begin{aligned}
  U &= mgR\cos\theta + \frac{1}{2}k_1\left(x_1+r\theta-De^{-i\omega t}\right)^2
       +\frac{1}{2}k_2\left(x_2-r\theta\right)^2.\end{aligned}$$

In general, we have used $De^{-i\omega t}$ to describe the drive, but in
our model, we used the imaginary part of this complex exponential. This
was in order to have the drive be in neutral position at the starting
time, which matches the data collection on the physical apparatus. We
took the drive to be entirely in a line, rather than in a circle as in
the physical system. We also treated the springs as ideal.

At any equilibrium position, $U'(\theta)$ is zero. Examination of
$U'(\theta)$ at the unstable equilibrium at the top of the disk yields

$$\begin{aligned}
  U'(\theta) &= mgR\sin\theta - k_1 r\left(x_1+r\theta-De^{-i\omega t}\right)
                +k_2 r\left(x_2-r\theta\right)\\\\
  U'(0) &= -k_1x_1 + k_2x_2 = 0\\\\
  k_1x_1 &= k_2x_2.\end{aligned}$$

Here the drive has been omitted, as we take it to be at the center of
its displacement when the apparatus is balanced.

Note that the potential and kinetic energies do not account for damping.
This will be addressed shortly. The Lagrangian (sans damping) is
$$L = \frac{1}{2}I\dot\theta^2 -
mgR\cos\theta - \frac{1}{2}k_1\left(x_1+r\theta-De^{-i\omega t}\right)^2\\\\
       -\frac{1}{2}k_2\left(x_2-r\theta\right)^2.$$
Euler’s equation shows

$$\begin{align}
  \mathbf{F}\cdot\frac{\partial\mathbf{r}}{\partial \theta}&=
  \frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial\dot\theta} - \frac{\partial L}{\partial \theta} \\\\
  -c\dot\theta &amp;= I\ddot\theta-\left(mgR\sin\theta-
  k_1r\left(x_1+r\theta-De^{-i\omega t}\right)
  +k_2r(x_2-r\theta)\right).\end{align}$$

The left-hand term is $-c \dot\theta$ because the external force from the
damper will eventually end up being proportional to the speed of
rotation. This $c$ does <span>*not*</span> correspond to the damping
coefficient for the eddy-current damper. The whole term is negative
because the damping always opposes the motion of the system. We assume
that the damping from the magnet overwhelms the effect of friction,
which we have ignored.

The relationship between the spring constants and $x_i$’s simplifies the
equation of motion to

$$\begin{aligned}
  -c\dot\theta &= I\ddot\theta-mgR\sin\theta +
  (k_1+k_2)r^2\theta - k_1rDe^{-i\omega t}.\end{aligned}$$

This is the equation of motion for the system.

At this point, we would normally transform this equation of motion into a
dimensionless equivalent for ease of analysis (and if you really want to
see the math, you can find it in the original paper).  However, we hope to
compare the behavior we predict based on the equation of motion with the
observed behavior of the system, and this comparison will be more explicit
if we instead use real (dimension-ful) time.

System parameters
=================

Our project is based on a physical system that is sitting in the
lab space downstairs. As such, we fixed most of our constants
to match the parameters of that system. We made this decision in order
to compare theoretical predictions with experimental results. Our
parameters are: $$\begin{array}{rcl}
\text{Mass of disk}                & M &   {0.120~\mathrm{kg}}\\\\
\text{Eccentric mass}              & m &   {0.01454~\mathrm{kg}}\\\\
\text{Radius of disk}              & R &   {0.0475~\mathrm{m}}\\\\
\text{Radius of pulley}            & r &   {0.024~\mathrm{m}}\\\\
\text{Left spring constant}        & k_1 & {3.12~\mathrm{N/m}}\\\\
\text{Right spring constant}       & k_2 & {3.13~\mathrm{N/m}}\\\\
\text{Acceleration due to gravity} & g &   {9.81~\mathrm{m/s^2}}\\\\
\text{Damping constant}            & c &   {0.0001~\mathrm{kg\,m/s}}\\\\
\text{Drive amplitude}             & D &   {0.0254~\mathrm{m}}\\\\
\end{array}$$ where the damping constant was chosen somewhat
arbitrarily. We chose the value of $c$ based on approximate behavior of
the system; that is with chaotic behavior beginning and ending between 0
and 1 Hz. The drive amplitude of the physical system can be varied.
Unless otherwise noted, we have used
$D=0.0254~\mathrm{m}$ in this report. The parameter
we will vary in most of this investigation is the drive frequency,
$\omega$.

## Results

### Equilibrum and Small Oscillations

The system, as one might gather from physical intuition, has an unstable
equilibrium position with the eccentric mass vertical, and two stable
equilibrium positions, one on each side. Graphing the potential energy
as a function of $\theta$, with no drive amplitude, agrees with
expectations, as shown below. The potential
energy increases as we wind the pendulum up further, with small dips as
the height, and potential energy due to gravity, fluctuate.

</figure>

The equilibrium angles can be calculated based on our physical
quantities; they are the values of $\theta$ that solve
$(k_1+k_2) r^2 \theta = m g R \sin(\theta),$ which in our setup are
\\(\\pm1.82265~\\mathrm{radians}\\) (and zero). The equilibrium point
at $\theta=0$ is unstable, while the other two are local minima in
potential energy and are thus stable. We expect that oscillation will be
around one of these stable equilibrium positions or switching between them.

For small oscillations, we expect the mass to stay in one of the
potential wells, exhibiting simple periodic motion. By setting the
damping term and drive amplitude to zero, we can investigate a
simplified version of this system. As shown in the plot below, a
small displacement from the stable equilibrium in either potential well
results in motion that looks a lot like simple harmonic oscillation.

General Behavior
----------------

Adding damping and drive, of course, makes the system more interesting.
The plots below show some time traces of the motion for
different drive frequencies. At low frequencies, the eccentric mass
stays in one well with complicated but periodic behavior. As we increase
frequency, we encounter some regions where the mass periodically
switches between positive and negative $\theta$, regions where it stays
in one potential well, and eventually, we encounter a region of chaotic
motion. At the highest frequencies the physical system is built for
(around 1 Hz), the system goes back to periodic motion in one well.

Phase plots {#sec:phaseplots}
-----------

The chaotic pendulum system may be viewed as traveling through the
three-dimensional phase space defined by the phase of the drive and the
eccentric mass’s angular position and velocity. The system is completely
deterministic, so if its location in phase space at a starting time is
known, its behavior can be predicted for all time. This means that if
the path traced out by the system in phase space crosses itself, it is
bound to repeat periodically in a closed loop.

A useful way of visualizing the motion of the system is using a phase
plot, which shows the bob’s angular velocity with respect to its angular
position. After an initial transient is allowed to die out, any periodic
behavior will be seen as a closed loop. An example of a phase plot of
periodic behavior is shown below.

  frequency of 0.500 Hz and starts plotting after the transient behavior
  has died out. It shows that the bob oscillates periodically between the
  two potential wells.

</figure>

Nonperiodic behavior leads to a more dynamic phase plot. An example
phase plot of nonperiodic behavior is shown below. Note that the path can
cross itself without becoming periodic because this two-dimensional phase
plot leaves out the phase of the drive, which is required in order to fully
describe the system’s behavior.

  frequency of 0.700 Hz. In this case the system exhibits nonperiodic
  behavior.

Poincaré plots {#sec:poincare}
--------------

Phase plots are useful for examining system behavior over short periods
of time, but tend to get cluttered over longer runs. In such cases, a
Poincaré plot can be used to examine the system’s behavior. Poincaré
plots have the same axes as phase plots, but the position and velocity
data are only taken once per drive cycle. Thus, if the behavior is
periodic with frequency equal to the drive frequency, we expect our
Poincaré plot to show a single dot — the system comes back to the same
state after each drive period. For chaotic motion, we expect many dots,
as the motion is not really periodic so the drive period will end with
the system in a wide variety of states. Here are
Poincaré plots for several drive frequencies:

Bifurcation diagrams {#sec:bifurcation}
--------------------

Bifurcation diagrams can be used in order to get a large-scale
understanding of a system. They show a set of points from Poincaré plots
at a range of frequencies and can give a good idea of boundaries of
chaos, as well as regions of period doubling. The large-scale
bifurcation diagram and a zoomed version of a region of period doubling
are shown below.

</figure>

From the large-scale plot we see that the main chaotic region occurs at
frequencies between about $0.65~\mathrm{Hz}$ to
$0.86~\mathrm{Hz}$. At frequencies immediately below the lower
end of this chaotic behavior the system behaves periodically with only
one period, before which it exhibits some regional periodic and chaotic
behavior. At frequencies just above the primary chaotic boundary, there
is a region of bifurcation (shown in the detailed plot above).

Comparison to Experiment
========================

Since we have access to the physical system modeled in this report, some
limited comparisons could be made between what our model predicts and
what we observed experimentally. As mentioned previously, most
parameters should be the same in experiment and model, so we expect
there to be substantial correlation between experimental and theoretical
results.

Onset of Chaos
--------------

A benefit of the bifurcation plot is the ease with which the frequency
at which chaos begins can be identified. From the bifurcation plot, the
onset of chaos is the frequency at which the dense region begins, around
$0.672~\mathrm{Hz}$.

While it is easy to identify the approximate onset of chaos by just
‘eyeballing’ the bifurcation plots, it is difficult to find a unique
onset of chaos using a script, because the lower chaotic boundary is
itself chaotic. For the purposes of the plots below, the ‘onset’ was
taken to be the first non-isolated vertical band in the bifurcation
plot, to within $0.001~\mathrm{Hz}$.

The onsets of chaos in our theoretical predictions compare closely with the
experimental values for the onset of chaos. Rough plots comparing the
frequencies at which chaos begins in the physical system and the
predictions from our model are shown in the plots below The frequencies at
which chaos begins are similar between theory and experiment, but the drive
amplitudes at which these frequencies of onset occur are slightly offset.

  simulated system. The trend here seems to be offset by an amplitude of
  about 0.2 to 0.3 inches, which can be adjusted by changing the damping
  constant.

</figure>


This difference can largely be accounted for by changing our damping
constant. Choosing $c=0.00015~\mathrm{kg\,m/s}$
yields the chaos onset plot shown below. This
new plot is more in line with the trend determined experimentally, but
the onset frequencies seem to be lower by around
$0.02~\mathrm{Hz}$. As mentioned previously, the value of the
damping coefficient is known to limited precision, and this altered
value is just as reasonable an estimate as the one we have used thus
far.

Qualitative Comparison of Poincaré Plots
----------------------------------------

The Poincaré plots produced by our model were also compared to the
Poincaré plots from the experimental setup in the Sophomore Lab. The
Poincaré plots are shown below, and they appear
qualitatively similar. It is possible that adjusting the damping
constant as discussed above would improve the resemblance.

Conclusion {#sec:conclusion}
==========

The behavior of a sinusoidally-driven chaotic pendulum has been
investigated for a variety of drive frequencies. The system exhibits
chaotic behavior, as shown in the phase plots, Poincaré plots, and
bifurcation diagrams. Branching behavior was observed for frequencies
just over those in the chaotic region.

The range of frequencies at which chaotic behavior was predicted to
begin aligned well with the observed onset of chaos, but the drive
amplitudes that generated these onset frequencies were offset by around
0.2 inches. This offset can be reduced by altering the damping constant.
Poincaré plots determined theoretically and experimentally appeared at
least qualitatively similar, which is striking given the assumptions made
from the outset.
